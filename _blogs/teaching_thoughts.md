I have been teaching at the university level for quite some time and I cherished the experience. When it comes to teaching, I wholeheartedly put my efforts in creating and delivering interesting tutorials/lectures. As a teacher, I see myself as a pacemaker where I enable my students to excel in their respective ways. As a learner, these opportunities granted me an excuse to exercise the Feynman Technique where I can relearn the same material through another perspective. Well, these are kind of expected when I signed up to be a teacher, but not the following when I became an instructor...

1. Designing the course syllabus: Great, we plan to give them few assignments, few quizzes, a midterm and a final. We're done right? No, not really. While we want to give the students sufficient amount of work and feedback to evaluate how they are performing, welcome COVID-19 where both the students and teachers are facing some wellness problem. Another aspect is actually the amount of time our TAs are able to put in. Who is going to design the assignment/exercises? The solutions? For some courses we might even have programming and written exercises. In that case, what about automarker? It is inevitable that either the TAs or the instructor will put in enormous amount of hours designing these.
2. Replying emails... Hello?: One thing I learned is that trying to answer all the emails is a losing battle. I thought it was a joke until I started teaching. Emails come from the school administrators, students, other instructors, TAs, auditors, etc. My current approach is to prioritize specific emails - instructors > TAs > school administrators > students > auditors. As you can see, **students** is almost at the last even though our job is to help the students learn. In that case, what can we do to have more efficient/effective communications with the students?
3. Energy management and work-life balance: I taught the Machine Learning course as an instructor while working as a full-time, not to mention that I do research on the side. While teaching is supposed to be a "contractor job", the amount of effort I need to put in is similar to a full-time position, and this is with the help of my mentors Prof. Fleet and Prof. Estrada. Immediately I admire how well my mentors can teach and publish papers at the same time. I tried but clearly it hurt my research output. At the same time, if they are handling this, why can't I? This definitely put a lot of pressure on me but my solution was, just chill once a week - no reading emails, no working, touch nothing related to work nor research. Do what you enjoy such as Netflix, Youtube, reading, NBA, etc. Having a day per week to reset my mind definitely helped my mental health.
4. You take the lead: When you are the instructor, you are the leader - everyone is looking up to you to make the decision, to lead, and to prepare the material. I guess I did an okay job but again the anxiety was real - how am I suppose to lead the group of undergrad students, my MSc and PhD TAs, and my colleagues? In terms of status, I definitely felt I am not a convincing leader - a MSc graduate being the instructor? In terms of experience, I had never been the "top" of the chain and I could always ask my boss for insights. Nonetheless, this was eye opening and I felt a lot of indecisiveness in me, but at least I did it.

In conclusion, I spent a lot of my mental energy on the Machine Learning course, stressed a lot on creating a reasonable syllabus with "fun and exiciting" lectures/tutorials/assignments/exam, stressed a lot on leading my amazing TAs and students, doubting my own ability to lead this course, and struggling to balance my life. Was it tough? Yes. Would I do it again? Most likely. The return is really high when you realize how many minds you are changing and shaping. I hope my students felt the same ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Hi, I'm Bryan! I recently completed my MScAC at the University of Toronto and was fortunate to have interned at Kindred AI. I am currently a RL researcher at Kindred AI and a sessional lecturer at the University of Toronto Scarborough for the ML course. My life-long goal is to create autonomous agents that are adaptive to real-life applications. To achieve my goal, I focus my research in Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Meta-Learning, and Continual Learning. I am actively working on this [repository](https://github.com/chanb/rl_sandbox_public) to reproduce RL research papers.

Outside of academic, I enjoy stuff related to basketball (sometimes soccer), cars, movies, and games! I used to be top 0.02% in League of Legends during season 3 (I was pretty proud) and was considering going pro.

Anyway, I am interested in collaborating on research projects and feel free to contact me at **chanb@cs.toronto.edu**! I'm fluent in English and Cantonese (Proficient in Mandarin) so feel free to message me in Chinese as well!

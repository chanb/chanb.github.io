Hi, I'm Bryan! I recently completed my MScAC at the University of Toronto and was fortunate to have interned at Kindred AI. I am currently a Teaching Assistant at the University of Toronto Scarborough for the AI course and the ML course. I am using my remaining time to do research projects (Hopefully I get a publication soon!). My life-long goal is to create autonomous agents that are adaptive to real-life applications. To achieve my goal, I focus my research in Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Meta-Learning, and Continual Learning.

Outside of academic, I enjoy stuff related to basketball (sometimes soccer), cars, movies, and games! I used to be top 0.02% in League of Legends during season 3 (I was pretty proud) and was considering going pro.

Anyway, I am interested in collaborating on research projects and feel free to contact me at **chanb@cs.toronto.edu**! I'm fluent in English and Cantonese (Proficient in Mandarin) so feel free to message me in Chinese as well!

My resume can be found [here](../files/Resume_No_Phone.pdf).

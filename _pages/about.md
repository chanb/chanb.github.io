I am currently a RL researcher at Kindred AI and a sessional lecturer at the University of Toronto Scarborough for the ML course. My life-long research goal is to create autonomous agents that can adapt continually in real life. To achieve my goal, my research focuses on Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Meta-Learning, and Continual Learning.

Currently, I am developing this [repository](https://github.com/chanb/rl_sandbox_public) to reproduce recent RL research papers. My goal with this work is to identify the problems with existing algorithms. Specifically, I am looking at these algorithms from the perspective of sample efficiency and exploration. I also investigate what "dirty tricks" we need in order to reproduce these papers. So far, this repository contains some model-free RL algorithms, Imitation Learning, and Hierarchical RL methods. I plan to add some model-based RL algorithms and some offline RL algorithms.

I am interested in collaborating on research projects so feel free to contact me via [**chanb@cs.toronto.edu**](chanb@cs.toronto.edu). For any conversation related to the Machine Learning course CSCC11H3 at UTSC, please contact me via [**bryanpy.chan@mail.utoronto.ca**](bryanpy.chan@mail.utoronto.ca).

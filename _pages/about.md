Hi, I'm Bryan! I am currently a RL researcher at Kindred AI and a sessional lecturer at the University of Toronto Scarborough for the ML course. My life-long research goal is to create autonomous agents that can adapt continually in real life. To achieve my goal, I focus my research in Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Meta-Learning, and Continual Learning.

I am actively working on this [repository](https://github.com/chanb/rl_sandbox_public) to reproduce RL research papers. My goal with this work is to identify the problems with existing algorithms. Specifically, I am looking at these algorithms from the perspective of sample efficiency and exploration. I also look at what "dirty tricks" we need in order to reproduce these papers. Currently, this work mainly reproduces model-free RL algorithms such as PPO and SAC. I am also exploring some Imitation Learning and Hierarchical RL methods. Eventually, I plan to add some model-based RL algorithms and some offline RL algorithms.

Anyway, I'm interested in collaborating on research projects so feel free to contact me via **chanb@cs.toronto.edu**! I'm fluent in English and Cantonese (Proficient in Mandarin) so feel free to message me in Chinese as well!

**NOTE:** For any conversation related to the Machine Learning course CSCC11H3 at UTSC, please contact me via **bryanpy.chan@mail.utoronto.ca**.

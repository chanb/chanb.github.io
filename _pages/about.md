I am currently a RL researcher at Kindred AI and a sessional lecturer at the University of Toronto Scarborough for the ML course. Before this, I completed my MSc in Applied Computing under the Computer Science department at University of Toronto and completed my HBSc in Computer Science at University of Toronto Scarborough.

My life-long research goal is to create autonomous agents that can adapt continually in real life. In particular, I am interested in developing an agent that can 1) understand the properties of the world from 2) minimal interactions with environment and from 3) observing other agents' behaviours. The more ambitious agent would be 4) curious about the world and explores to answer its own questions and have the ability to 5) build a repertoire of skills such that they can compose the skills to complete long horizon tasks. To achieve my goal, my research focuses on Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Robotics, Meta-Learning, and Continual Learning.

As a first step, I am developing this [repository](https://github.com/chanb/rl_sandbox_public) to implement (and reproduce) recent RL research papers. My goal with this work is to identify the problems with existing algorithms. Specifically, I am looking at these algorithms from the perspective of sample efficiency and exploration. I also investigate what "dirty tricks" we need in order to reproduce these papers. So far, this repository contains some model-free RL algorithms, Imitation Learning algorithms, and Hierarchical RL algorithms. I plan to add some model-based RL algorithms and offline RL algorithms.

I am interested in collaborating on research projects so feel free to contact me via [**chanb@cs.toronto.edu**](mailto:chanb@cs.toronto.edu). For any conversation related to the Machine Learning course CSCC11H3 at UTSC, please contact me via [**bryanpy.chan@mail.utoronto.ca**](mailto:bryanpy.chan@mail.utoronto.ca).

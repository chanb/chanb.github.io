I host weekly tutorials where I convey concepts related to lectures and provide examples so students can have a visualization on the concepts applied. I sometimes make tutorial notes for other TA's and make assignments for students so the teaching crew can evaluate the students' performance. Other than that, of course there is the marking part where we sit for half a day and enjoy our pizzas :)
